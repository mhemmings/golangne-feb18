# Demo 5

A simple Hello World example, managed using [Up](https://github.com/apex/up).

You'll notice this is just a normal Go webserver that you will be used to. It can reasoned about just like any normal Go server, and run with `go run main.go`.

However, with the Up tool it can be deployed to a serverless environment just by running `up`.
