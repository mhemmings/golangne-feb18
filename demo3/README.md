# Demo 3

You will need [Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex) installed to run this demo.

Simply running `init.sh` will call `apex init` and then replace the Javascript template with the Go example from demo 1.

After running `apex deploy` you'll have the rest of the Apex tool to play with (see `apex help`)
