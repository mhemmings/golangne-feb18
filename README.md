# Serverless Go

**Golang North East - 27th February 2018**


All these examples run on AWS, so you'll need an AWS account. You'll probably end up paying <$0.01.
Each demo has separate instructions and notes. The most useful/fun is probably demo 6.

### Demo 1 - 2

The very basics. No tooling to manage them, so you'll be uploading zips.

### Demo 3 - 4

Managing functions with [Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex), adds function complexity and shows event based invocation.

### Demo 4 - 6

Functions as webservices using [Up](https://github.com/apex/up)
